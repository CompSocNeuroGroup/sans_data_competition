# CompSAN Naturalistic fMRI Data Analysis Challenge 2022
CompSAN is very excited to announce the inaugural Naturalistic fMRI Data Analysis Challenge for SANS 2022. Naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a unique opportunity to study the neural basis of social, cognitive, and affective processing. Data from naturalistic conditions are rich and dynamic, and present both an opportunity and a challenge to analysis methods.

This data challenge provides the chance to demonstrate the application of new algorithms and models to naturalistic fMRI data, in order to shed new light on social and affective neural processing at the intra- and/or inter-subject level. We welcome submissions from all levels of imaging experience, from individual trainees new to naturalistic data to groups well established in this approach.

The goals of the challenge include: a) increasing a diversity of analysis approaches in SANS community; b) further theory development based on computational approaches; and c) provide a forum for trainees of all levels to develop and explore new computational/analytic skills. While we are framing this challenge as a competition, we hope that this will be a fun and not-too-serious experience for everyone involved.

Entries for the competitive portion of the challenge will be judged on i) novelty/originality of analysis approach; ii) the connection between analysis approach and social and affective neuroscience theory/topics; iii) and robustness and replicability of results. Winners and prizes will be announced during the computational symposium at the 2022 SANS conference. Entrants are also welcome to opt-out of the competition and enter just for fun/learning.

There is no benchmark to work towards or specific problem in the data to discover. Instead, we encourage you to be creative!

## How to enter the challenge:
1. First, download the [??} dataset here:

2. If you are new to naturalistic data processing, we recommend that you run through the Naturalistic Data Analysis tutorials here: https://naturalistic-data.org/content/intro.html

3. Form a team, or work solo. Once you are ready, register your team/individual entry (link). Registration is free, and will open March 4th, 2022. You may enter as late as the day of submission.

4. Join the Slack (link).

5. Submit a poster and extended abstract (3 pages), and notebook/matlab script (w details on associated dependencies). The abstract should include separate sections for background, methods, results and conclusions. Entrants will have the option of making their notebook/scripts publicly available. The deadline for submissions is April 2nd, 2022. At the time of submission, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of competition.

6. Especially important for trainees (at all stages): complete a survey on your learning experience and the challenges you faced.

## Struggling for inspiration? Here are some possible ideas:

Dynamics and hidden order in naturalistic imaging data revealed using machine learning
Affective states and associated brain activity are highly dynamic. Spatial differences in the temporal dynamics of brain responses can lead to hidden order not fully captured by standard, statically-defined networks. Machine learning approaches might provide a powerful means to discover such hidden order.

Nonlinear and/or time-warping methods for intersubject correlations
Standard methods for measuring intersubject synchrony typically rely on linear correlations in the time domain. However, individual differences in the dynamics of spontaneous activity might not be noise, and methods that can account for speed/timing differences and nonlinear relationships between subjects might reveal new information about group-level synchrony.

Encoding models of social cognition using naturalistic conditions
Encoding models have been of great value in understanding sensory and perceptual responses to naturalistic stimuli. As the sophistication of computational models of social cognition increases, so does the potential to apply these as encoding models to understand the neural basis of social cognition.
